```{admonition} Under construction
:class: warning

We are in the process of migrating the documentation from LaTeX producing a PDF file to Markedly Structured Text (MyST) and Sphinx producing this online documentation, a PDF file, and epub.

The developer guide has been migrated (but is still a work in progress).
We are starting to migrate the user guide.
